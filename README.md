# ConnectFour

1- Description of the Game 
  Connect Four is a two-player board game in which the players first choose a character and then take turns dropping one from the top into a seven-column, six-row         vertically suspended grid.
  The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. 
  The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

3- The approach taken
  - include seperate HTML/CSS/JavaScript files
  - HTML include the structure of board, cells, winning message and restart button.
  - CSS include images for (background, player one and player two) styling for (board, cells, winning message, restart button)
  - Javascript -> using query selector, start game function using forEach, click function using event listener and event target, changing user function, reset game function using classList.
